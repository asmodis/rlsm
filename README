rlsm stands for *R*egular *L*anguages and *S*yntactic *M*onoids.

Source is availible from http://github.com/asmodis/rlsm.

== DESCRIPTION:
Monoids play a large role in the theory of formal languages, especially in the 
theory of regular languages. If +L+ is a regular language, there exists a finite monoid, 
the so called syntactic monoid of +L+, and it is possible to get more informations about 
the language by investigating properties of the monoid. On the other hand one is 
interessted in the question which monoids are syntactic.

The rlsm gem allows the study of both questions.

== SYNOPSIS:

  require 'rlsm'
  
  m = RLSM::Monoid.new '012 112 212'
  m.syntactic? # => true
  m.isomorph_to?(m) # => true
  m.commutative? # => false

  m2 = RLSM::Monoid.from_regexp("ab*")
  m2.aperiodic?

== INSTALL:

  gem install rlsm
